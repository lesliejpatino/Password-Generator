# Password Generator

* This website generates a custom password for the user dependent on their preferences. At minimum, the user must select the length of their password and one criteria for their password such as lower or uppercase letters, numbers or special characters. Once the criteria is selected, the generator displays a password for the user. 
The generator will display 2 types of error messages if the user either does not select an appropriate length or if they do not select at least one criteria to include in their password.
